# Tweet Crawler

Tweet Crawler is a command-line utility that automatically collects tweet data from the Twitter Streaming API. Using this program, you can collect data about specific user-defined topics on Twitter (e.g. "programming", "qatar", "world cup", etc.).

In addition to displaying the collected tweets on the command-line, this utility also stores the JSON for these tweets within a database (MongoDB).

## Getting Started

Building and running Tweet Crawler on your machine should be a pretty straightforward process. In order to do so, you first need to install suitable versions of Docker and Docker Compose.

Making use of Docker (and Docker Compose) greatly simplifies the Tweet Crawler setup process and will make it easier for you to run this program on the platform of your choice.

If you already have up-to-date versions of these programs, feel free to skip straight to the [Install and Run](https://github.com/qcrisw/tweet-crawler/#install-and-run) section.

 5. Follow the Linux [post-install instructions](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/)

### Install and Run

If you've fulfilled the above prerequisites, it's very simple to download and run Tweet Crawler from the command line (PowerShell, Terminal, etc.):

Clone the project repository from Github
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/qcrisw/tweet-crawler.git
cd tweet-crawler
```

#### Configuration

Before you can build Tweet Crawler, you need to provide valid credentials to access the Twitter API.

To setup these credentials, follow the [instructions here](https://www.slickremix.com/docs/how-to-get-api-keys-and-tokens-for-twitter/).

Once you've got these in hand, run the following command:

```
cp env-sample .env
```
Edit the `.env` file by inserting your Twitter app credentials and save the file.


Now, run the following command to build Tweet Crawler:
```
docker-compose build
```

#### Running Tweet Crawler

Simply enter the following command at the terminal:

```
docker-compose run pycrawler <keyword1> <keyword2> ...
```

...where each `<keyword>` is a topic you're interested in streaming from Twitter.
